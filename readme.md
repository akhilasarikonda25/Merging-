create one file in main branch and added some code "app.py" 
now create one branch and open same file in newly created branch and added some more lines of code, branch name is dev2
After adding some more lines in new branch add the file and commit those changes 
Now switch to the main branch and open file and see the code newly added code should not add in main branch bcoz it is added in new branch 
now merge the dev2 branch from main use the following command 
git merge dev2 
and push the file to remote repository and finally check the file content in git hub
